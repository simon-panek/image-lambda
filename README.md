# Project: Image Lambda

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simon-panek/image-lambda)

## Description

- A lambda function that resizes an image when uploaded to an S3 bucket and stores the new thumbnail in a separate s3 bucket with a predictable naming pattern.

## Lambda Function Source Code

- The code for this lambda function was provided by Amazon via their [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html)

## Lambda Use

- Upload an image to [S3 Bucket]()
- Access thumbnail image in [S3 Bucket]()

## Issues During Deployment

- I encountered a number of issues during deployment, pretty much all of them were self inflicted.
